Given  two integers N and M. 
The problem is to find the number closest to N and divisible by M. 
If there are more than one such number, then output the one having maximum absolute value.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 13 , M = 4
Output:
12
Explanation:
12 is the Closest Number to
13 which is divisible by 4.

Example 2:
Input:
N = -15 , M = 6
Output:
-18
Explanation:
-12 and -18 are both similarly close to
-15 and divisible by 6. but -18 has
the maximum absolute value.
So, Output is -18


Solution: 
class Solution {
    static int closestNumber(int N , int M) {
        
        int rem=N%M;
        if(rem==0){
            return N;
            
        }
        int i=N,j=N;
        while(true){
            if(i%M==0)return i;
            else i--;
            if(j%M==0)return j;
            else j++; 
        }
    }
};
