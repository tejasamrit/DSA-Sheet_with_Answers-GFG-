Given an integer n, find the square root of n. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value.
Floor value of any number is the greatest Integer which is less than or equal to that number

Examples:
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.


Solution: 
class Solution
{
     long floorSqrt(long x)
	 {
		int i=1;
		while(i*i<=x){
		    i++;
		}
		return i-1;
	 }
}
