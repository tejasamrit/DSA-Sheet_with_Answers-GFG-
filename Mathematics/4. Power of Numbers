Given a number n, find the value of n raised to the power of its own reverse.
Note: The result will always fit into a 32-bit signed integer.

Examples:
Input: n = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The reverse of 2 is 2, and 22 = 4.
Input: n = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: The reverse of 10 is 1 (leading zero is discarded), and 101 = 10.
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The reverse of 3 is 3, and 33 = 27.


Solution: 

class Solution
{   
    long power(int N,int R)
    {
        long div = 1000000007;
        if(R==0){
            return 1;
        }
        if(R%2==0){
            long value=power(N,R/2);
            return(value*value)%div;
        }
        else{
            long value= power(N,R-1);
            return(value*N)%div;
        }
        
    }

}
