Ritu has all numbers from 1 to n in an array, and the arr of length is n-1 except for one number. 
You have to return the missing number, Ritu doesn't have from 1 to n.

Note: Don't use Sorting

Examples:
Input: n = 4, arr = [1,  4,  3]
Output: 2     
Explanation: Ritu doesn't have the number 2
Input: n = 5, arr = [2,  5,  3,  1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Ritu doesn't have number 4 in her collection


Solution: 
class Solution {
    public static int missingNumber(int n, int[] arr) {
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            sum+=i;
        }
        int asum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
            asum+=arr[i];
        }
        return sum-asum;
    }
}
