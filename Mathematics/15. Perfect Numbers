Given a number n, check if a number is perfect or not. 
A number is said to be perfect if sum of all its factors excluding the number itself is equal to the number. 

Examples:
Input: n = 6
Output: true 
Explanation: Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. Excluding 6 their sum is 6 which is equal to N itself. So, it's a Perfect Number.

Input: n = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10. Excluding 10 their sum is 8 which is not equal to N itself. So, it's not a Perfect Number.


solution: 
class Solution {
    static int isPerfectNumber(int n) {
        
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(n%i==0){
                sum+=i;
            }
        }
        return sum==n?1:0;
    }
};
