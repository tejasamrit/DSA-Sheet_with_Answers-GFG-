(*  Question:
Given a number n, determine whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Examples :
Input: n = 7
Output: true
Explanation: 7 has exactly two divisors: 1 and 7, making it a prime number.

Input: n = 1
Output: false
Explanation: 1 has only one divisor (1 itself), which is not sufficient for it to be considered prime.
 *)

 
 Solution:
class Solution{
    static int isPrime(int N){
        if(N==1)return 0;
        for(int i=2;i*i<=N;i++){
            if(N%i==0){
                return 0;
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
}
