Given a positive integer n, determine whether it is odd or even. 
Return a string "even" if the number is even and "odd" if the number is odd.

Examples:
Input: n = 15
Output: odd
Explanation: The number is not divisible by 2

Input: n = 44
Output: even
Explanation: The number is divisible by 2


Solution: 
class Solution {
    static String oddEven(int n) {
        if(n%2==0)
        {
            return "even";
        }
        else{
             return "odd";

        }
    }
}
