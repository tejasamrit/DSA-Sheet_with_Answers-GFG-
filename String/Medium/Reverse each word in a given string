You are given a string s. 
You need to reverse each word in it where the words are separated by spaces and return the modified string.

Note: The string may contain leading or trailing spaces, or multiple spaces between two words. 
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words, and no extra spaces should be included.

Examples:
Input: s = " i like this program very much "
Output: "i ekil siht margorp yrev hcum"
Explanation: The words are reversed as follows:
"i" -> "i","like"->"ekil",
"this"->"siht","program" -> "margorp",
"very" -> "yrev","much" -> "hcum".

Input: s = " pqr mno "
Output: "rqp onm"
Explanation: The words are reversed as follows:
"pqr" -> "rqp" ,
"mno" -> "onm"


Solutoin:
class Solution
{
   
    String reverseWords(String S)
    {
        String s="", s1="";
        for(int i=0;i<S.length();i++){
            if(S.charAt(i)!='.'){
                s=S.charAt(i)+s;
            }
            else{
                s1+=s+".";
                s="";
            }
        }
        s1=s1+s;
        return s1;
    }
}
