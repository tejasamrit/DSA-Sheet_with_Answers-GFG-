Given a string S of lowercase alphabets, check if it is isogram or not.
An Isogram is a string in which no letter occurs more than once.

Example 1:
Input:
S = machine
Output: 1
Explanation: machine is an isogram
as no letter has appeared twice. Hence
we print 1.

Example 2:
Input:
S = geeks
Output: 0
Explanation: geeks is not an isogram
as 'e' appears twice. Hence we print 0.


Solution:
class Solution
{
    //Function to check if a string is Isogram or not.
    static boolean isIsogram(String s){
        char arr[]=s.toCharArray();
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<arr.length;j++){
                if(arr[i]==arr[j]){
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
