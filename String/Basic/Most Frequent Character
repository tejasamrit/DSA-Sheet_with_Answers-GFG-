Given a string str of lowercase alphabets. 
The task is to find the maximum occurring character in the string str. 
If more than one character occurs the maximum number of time then print the lexicographically smaller character.

Example 1:
Input:
str = testsample
Output: e
Explanation: e is the character which is having the highest frequency.

Example 2:
Input:
str = output
Output: t
Explanation:  t and u are the characters with the same frequency, but t is lexicographically smaller.


solution:
class Solution
{
    //Function to find the maximum occurring character in a string.
    static final int CHAR=256;
    public static char getMaxOccuringChar(String line)
    {
        int arr[]=new int[CHAR];
        for(int i=0;i<line.length();i++){
            arr[line.charAt(i)]++;
        }
        int max=0;
        for(int i=1;i<CHAR;i++){
            if(arr[i]>arr[max])max=i;
        }
        return (char)max;
    }
    
}
