You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Examples :
Input: s = "abba"
Output: true
Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

Input: s = "abc" 
Output: false
Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.


solution:
class Solution {
    int isPalindrome(String S) {
        int i=0,j=S.length()-1;
        while(i<=j){
            if(S.charAt(i)==S.charAt(j)){
                 i++;
                 j--;
            }
            else{
            return 0;
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
};
