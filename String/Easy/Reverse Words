Given a string s, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. Words are separated by spaces.

Note: The string may contain leading or trailing spaces, or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words, and no extra spaces should be included.

Examples :
Input: s = " i like this program very much "
Output: "much very program this like i"
Explanation: After removing extra spaces and reversing the whole string (not individual words), the input string becomes "much very program this like i". 

Input: s = " pqr mno "
Output: "mno pqr"
Explanation: After removing extra spaces and reversing the whole string, the input string becomes "mno pqr". 


Solution:
class Solution 
{
    //Function to reverse words in a given string.
    String reverseWords(String S)
    {
        String str[]=S.split("[.]");
        String ans="";
        for(int i=str.length-1;i>=0;i--){
            ans=ans+str[i];
            if(i!=0){
                ans=ans+".";
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
