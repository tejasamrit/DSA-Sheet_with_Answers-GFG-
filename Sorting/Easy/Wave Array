Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place). In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....
If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Note: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to change the original array.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 2, 1, 4, 3, 5.

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9.

Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: [1]



class Solution {
    public static void convertToWave(int n, int[] arr) {
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i=i+2){
            int temp=arr[i];
            arr[i]=arr[i+1];
            arr[i+1]=temp;
        }
    }
