Given an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than the size of the array, the task is to find the kth smallest element in the given array.

Follow up: Don't solve it using the inbuilt sort function.
Examples :
Input: arr[] = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k = 3
Output:  7
Explanation: 3rd smallest element in the given array is 7.

class Solution{
    public static int kthSmallest(int[] arr, int l, int r, int k) 
    { 
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        return arr[k-1];
    } 
}
