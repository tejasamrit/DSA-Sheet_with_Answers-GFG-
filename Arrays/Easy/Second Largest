Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. 
If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.

Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.


Solution:
class Solution {
    int print2largest(int arr[], int n) {
        int larg=arr[0];
        int slarg=-1;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]>larg){
                slarg=larg;
                larg=arr[i];
            }
            if(arr[i]>slarg && arr[i]<larg){
                slarg=arr[i];
            }
        }
        return slarg;
    }
}
