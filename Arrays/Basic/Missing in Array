You are given an array arr of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.

Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.


Solution:

class Solution {
    int missingNumber(int array[], int n) {
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            sum+=i;
        }
        int nsum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
            nsum+=array[i];
        }
        return sum-nsum;
    }
}
